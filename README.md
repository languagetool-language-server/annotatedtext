# annotatedtext

A lightweight JavaScript library for converting markup documents into an annotated text format consumable by LanguageTool.

# Usage

To generate annotated text from markdown, leveraging [remark-parse](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-parse):

```js
"use strict";
var builder = require("annotatedtext");
var markdown = "# Some Markdown, possibly read from a file.";
var annotatedtext = builder.md(markdown);
```

To generate annotated text from html, leveraging [rehyp-parse](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/tree/master/packages/rehype-parse):

```js
"use strict";
var builder = require("annotatedtext");
var hypertext = "# Some HTML, possibly read from a file.";
var annotatedtext = builder.html(hypertext);
```

Additional formats can be implemented using the [API](#API). See below for details.


# Motivation

Provide an easier way of running LanguageTool on markup documents by separating the text from the markup.

# Installation

npm:

```sh
npm install annotatedtext
```

# API

## `build(text, parse)`

## `compose(text, textnodes)`

## `collect(tokens, [nodes])`

# Tests
